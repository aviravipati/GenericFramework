Steps
Customize the functionality by replacing assets with the background images of the app you are working on
and replacing the values of the below variable

<pre>
 var titlesAndSubtitles: [(title: String, subtitle: String)] = 
 [("Discover Inner Peace", "Experience Tranquility Through Meditation"),("Stress Relief Anytime, Anywhere","Find Calmness in the Midst of Chaos"),
 ("Guided Meditations for All","Journey to Mindfulness with Expert Instructors") ]
</pre>
